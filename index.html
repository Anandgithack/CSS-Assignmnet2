            When compairing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
            <br><br>
            In CSS selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements of web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.
            <br><br>
            There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.
